                Instagram has officially launched a new set of AI-powered tools designed to make photo editing simpler and faster for content creators. The features, announced on Monday, include automatic background removal, smart filters, and quick enhancement options that leverage artificial intelligence to suggest the best edits for a userâ€™s photo.
                The update is available globally for both Android and iOS users. According to Instagram, these tools aim to help creators save time and maintain a consistent visual style without the need for third-party apps.

            <h2>Study Reveals Peak Social Media Engagement Times in 2024</h2>
            <p>
                A recent study by Social Trends Analytics has identified the optimal times for content creators to post on major social media platforms in 2024. The data, gathered from over 2 million posts across Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, indicates that weekday mornings between 8 and 10 AM consistently yield the highest engagement rates.
                The report suggests that creators who schedule posts during these windows see up to 40% more likes, shares, and comments compared to those who post at random. Researchers advise content creators to use platform analytics to fine-tune their posting times for maximum visibility and reach.
